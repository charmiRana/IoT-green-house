# IoT-green-house

This project is based on JAVA and Python. I have measured temperature, humidity, pressure, Co2 gas, soil moisture, soil PH, and light level inside the green house.
All sensors are handled by Python and Gateway application is handled by JAVA. For different plants all the values are different but I considered all the values for tomato plants.
However, all the events need to be changed over time with conditions of weather, different seasons, plant situation and growth.

Protocol Stack: MQTT, SMTP, HTTP API

Cloud service: Ubidots

Flow:
•	Sent all sensor data and device utilization using python MQTT client to JAVA gateway application.
•	Used HTTP POST API to send data to cloud from gateway application.
•	Updated values of actuator from cloud and subscribed using MQTT java client.
•	Sent updated actuator data to device using MQTT.
•	Python takes updated values and create actuation if needed.
•	Python mails all sensor data to user using SMTP.

Sensors values are generated by sensorValueGenerator in device application. Anyone can use sensors as hardware part.
