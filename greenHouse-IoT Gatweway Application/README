Iot Gatway application connects with Ubidots cloud and update values of sensor on the cloud. As per the selected conditions it will fetchthe details from ubidots cloud.
And send it to the python device application. 

I have used ubidots api and for that you will need .pem file, that is the certificate for ssl connection with ubidots.
